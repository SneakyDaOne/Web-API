# Web-API
Persona:
The current persona I have utilised is for a forgetful user who is terrible at keeping track of their spendings and would spend all their wealth at once without even knowing that they did.

App description: 
This app is intended to help my target audiences such as forgetful people, individuals who are too busy to keep track of certain spendings or overall groups who are inclined to go to a party and forget how much they spent the next day. The intention is for the app to act as a simple reminder of how much they have spend over a period of time and how much left in terms of overall wealth they have. I have included functionality for the user to record all their earnings and spendings along with functionality to measure their net worth in order to gauge whether it would be better or not for them to save on money. This is as it is easier for individuals to be aware of information if a visual form of that information is presented to them.

Extensibility:
The app is designed to be modifiable so as to include other functions that can be applied to a larger range of target audience. This includes the fields of income and assets which can in later iterations, be linked to a bank API in order to accurately and dynamically record the user’s wealth. This can branch from one single bank API to multiple different bank API’s, all in order to provide a more accurate representation of user wealth. Another additional future functionality is a calendar to record when certain transactions would occur in the future or when the user is expected to receive income from any sources. There is an issue of security, this involves both the API and app security, one of which is managed by the host/provider of the API and the other is a developer responsibility.
